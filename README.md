# AzaveaJobApp
This is the code I am submitting for the Entry-Level Software Engineer position at Azavea. I am submitting R code, as it is the coding language I use currently. I understand that if granted this position, I would need to change languages. I have been interested in learning Python for some time and would welcome the occasion to do so. In the meantime, I hope you will be able to assess this R code sufficiently enough to determine my fit for this position.  

This code performs the task of generating the GIFs that I use in the pop-ups of the COVID-19 map I made for the School District of Philadelphia as part of a contract position I am just finishing up with them. The full project, including the GIFs this code will create, can be seen here: https://tesladubois-d.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=29a0e036b0714963b1d31531c119b7fb.
